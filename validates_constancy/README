== Validates Constancy for Active Record

http://constancy.rubyforge.org

Compatible with Rails v1.2.2 and v1.2.3 (Active Record v1.15.2 and v1.15.3)


=== Introduction

This RubyGem and Rails plugin adds a +validates_constancy_of+ validation to
Active Record. It allows you to prevent particular database fields from being
changed after a record is created. A validation error occurs on updates if an
attribute of a model object is different from its value in the database.


=== Installing Validates Constancy

The code is packaged as both a RubyGem and a Rails plugin. You can use either
one, depending on what your needs are.

<b>The Validates Constancy gem</b> is compatible with various versions of Rails
(Active Record) -- see the _test_ subdirectories of
http://constancy.rubyforge.org/svn/gem/branches. You can install the gem with
the command:

  gem install validates_constancy

<b>The Validates Constancy plugin</b> is compatible with the latest released
version of the Rails framework (and possibly also other versions -- see
http://constancy.rubyforge.org/svn/plugin/test). You can install the plugin with
the command:

  ruby script/plugin install http://constancy.rubyforge.org/svn/plugin/validates_constancy

Use the gem (http://constancy.rubyforge.org/svn/gem) if you're using Active
Record apart from Rails, or for compatibility with a version of Rails (Active
Record) that is not supported by the plugin. Use the plugin if your Rails
version is up to date and if you like the convenience of a Rails plugin.


=== Using constancy validation

Here's how to use this validation in your code.

  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    
    # Prevent changes to Person#social_security_number.
    validates_constancy_of :social_security_number
    
  end


==== Options

The validation takes two options, <tt>:if</tt> and <tt>:message</tt>. These may
be familiar because several of Active Record's validations also use them. The
<tt>:if</tt> option takes a Proc, or a symbol, or string with a model object
argument and a return value of +true+ or +false+.

  class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
    
    # Prevent changes to Comment#text if it is "locked."
    validates_constancy_of :text, :if => Proc.new { |comment| comment.locked? }
    
  end

The default error message is "can't be changed". Use your own error message by
specifying the <tt>:message</tt> option.

  class LicensePlate < ActiveRecord::Base
    
    # Prevent changes to LicensePlate#number.
    validates_constancy_of :number,
                           :message => 'is off-limits! What are you thinking?'
    
  end

More than one model attribute can be specified. Any specified options will be
applied to all the specified attributes.


==== Warning

With associations, validate the constancy of a foreign key, not the instance
variable itself: <tt>validates_constancy_of :invoice_id</tt> instead of
<tt>validates_constancy_of :invoice</tt>.

Also note the warning under <em>Inheritable callback queues</em> in
http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Callbacks.html. "In order for
inheritance to work for the callback queues, you must specify the callbacks
before specifying the associations. Otherwise, you might trigger the loading of
a child before the parent has registered the callbacks and they won't be
inherited." Validates Constancy uses these callback queues, so you'll want to
specify associations *after* +validates_constancy_of+ statements in your model
classes.


=== Running automated tests for Validates Constancy

There's a suite of tests that exercises all the functionality of Validates
Constancy. You can check out a version of the test suite from the repository
according to the version of Rails (Active Record) it works with.

==== Gem

[<b>Rails v1.2.2 (Active Record v1.15.2)</b>] Check out http://constancy.rubyforge.org/svn/gem/tags/rel_1-0-0/test/rails_1-2-2
[<b>Rails v1.2.3 (Active Record v1.15.3)</b>] Check out http://constancy.rubyforge.org/svn/gem/tags/rel_1-0-0/test/rails_1-2-3
[<b>Edge Rails</b>]                           Check out http://constancy.rubyforge.org/svn/gem/tags/rel_1-0-0/test/rails_edge

==== Plugin

[<b>Rails v1.2.2 (Active Record v1.15.2)</b>] Check out http://constancy.rubyforge.org/svn/plugin/test/rails_1-2-2
[<b>Rails v1.2.3 (Active Record v1.15.3)</b>] Check out http://constancy.rubyforge.org/svn/plugin/test/rails_1-2-3
